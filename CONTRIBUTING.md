## 🏗️ Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use type hints where possible
- Write descriptive variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and small

### Testing
```bash
# Run basic functionality test
python session_manager.py --help

# Test semantic search
python regenerate_embeddings.py --verify

# Test with sample data
python examples/test_basic_functionality.py
```

### Performance Considerations
- The tool should work with up to 5000 sessions
- Search should complete in under 200ms
- Memory usage should stay under 500MB
- Embedding generation should be reasonable

## 🎯 Priority Areas

### High Priority
- [ ] **Vector DB adapters** - Optional backends for larger scales
- [ ] **Web UI** - Browser-based session management
- [ ] **Multi-project support** - Handle multiple codebases
- [ ] **Performance optimizations** - Faster search and indexing

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Team collaboration** - Shared session repositories
- [ ] **Session diff visualization** - See changes between sessions
- [ ] **Export functionality** - PDF, HTML reports
- [ ] **Integration plugins** - VS Code, JetBrains IDEs

### Nice to Have
- [ ] **Session templates** - Predefined session types
- [ ] **Metrics and analytics** - Usage statistics
- [ ] **Advanced search operators** - Boolean queries
- [ ] **Session tagging system** - Organize sessions by tags

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- `SessionStateManager`: Main class handling session lifecycle
- `SemanticSearch`: Handles embedding generation and search
- `ConversationMonitor`: Tracks Claude CLI conversations
- `BackgroundAutoSaver`: Automatic session saving

### Key Design Principles
1. **No mandatory external dependencies**: Should work offline
2. **Privacy first**: All data stays local by default
3. **Claude Code integration**: Seamless CLI workflow
4. **Backwards compatibility**: Don't break existing sessions

### Adding New Features

1. **Create feature branch**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
```

2. **Add your implementation**
- Modify relevant classes in `session_manager.py`
- Add CLI commands if needed
- Update help text and documentation

3. **Test thoroughly**
- Test with various session types
- Verify performance impact
- Check edge cases

4. **Update documentation**
- Add to README if user-facing
- Update CLI help text
- Add examples if complex
